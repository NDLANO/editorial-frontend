An independent clause is a clause that can stand on its own, by itself. It does not need to be joined to any other clauses, because it contains all the necessary information to be a complete sentence. You can divide the following sentence in two and still have two grammatically correct sentences – they are independent of each other. Example: The end of the concert was especially pleasing, and I liked the song they played. Sentence 1: The end of the concert was especially pleasing. (Independent clause) Sentence 2: I liked the song they played. (Independent clause) When we have two independent clauses together like this, we separate them using a comma. A dependent clause, on the other hand, does not express a complete thought and cannot form a simple sentence by itself. Example: He likes to eat but doesn’t really like to cook. Sentence 1: He likes to eat. (Independent clause) Sentence 2: Doesn’t really like to cook. (Dependent clause) In the example, the clause is dependent because it lacks a subject.
